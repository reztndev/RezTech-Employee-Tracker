## Description
This is an node/SQL-based employee tracking program that creates a database tracking yor company's departments, roles and employees via a SQL database.

Using inquirer terminal commands, the user is not only able to view the company's departments, roles, and employees, but also add departments, roles, and employees. You can also update an employee's role within the company.

## Usage
First, ensure that the SQL database "company" is running by entering the following commands via the terminal:

psql -U postgres
\i database/schema.sql
\i database/seeds.sql
\dt

Once you have confirmed the database is running, navigate to server.js in your terminal and enter "node server.js" to get the program running.

In your terminal, a list of commands will appear that you can navigate to. To select, scrolling over the desired command and press "enter."

## Tests
In the future, I would like to incorporate both more data within the tables, and further opportunities for user interaction with this data. Ideas for further data within the table include employment start date, list of any recognitions, vacation time available for the employee, annual bonus. Ideas for user interaction include being able to delete data from the tables, or extra data to create sub-tables within the database as needed.
